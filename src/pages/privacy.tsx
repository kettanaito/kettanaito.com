          As a fellow developer, and as a human being, I value and respect
          privacy on the Internet. I work hard on the content published on this
          blog, and it's important for me to see which topics you like, and what
          needs improvement. To do so, this website uses Google Analytics to
          gather <em>anonymous</em> statistics about your usage of the website.

        <h2>What data is being collected?</h2>
        <p>
          The following data is being collected during your visits of the
          website:
        </p>

          <li>Amount of page visits</li>
          <li>Country of the visitor</li>
